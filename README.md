# LeetCode Problem Solving & Core Concept Exploration

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This isn't just a collection of accepted solutions; it's a journey focused on deeply understanding the fundamental concepts behind algorithmic problems and exploring different ways to implement them.

## Learning Philosophy

My learning approach emphasizes a strong foundation in core programming concepts. Instead of simply aiming for a "correct" solution, I strive to:

* **Identify the underlying algorithmic concepts and data structures** at play in each problem.
* **Explore multiple valid implementations** of the same concept, even for a single problem. This might involve iterative vs. recursive solutions, different data structure choices, or varying levels of optimization.
* **Analyze the time and space complexity** of each implementation to understand their trade-offs.
* **(Occasionally) Implement fundamental concepts in different programming languages** to solidify my understanding of the core idea beyond language-specific syntax and features.

This repository is a testament to this learning process, aiming for a comprehensive understanding rather than just a high number of solved problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### 1. Problem Solving Log (`problem-solving-log/`)

This directory contains my solutions to specific LeetCode problems. Each problem has its own subdirectory (named after the problem title or a clear abbreviation) and includes:

* **`README.md`**: A problem-specific overview, including a link to the LeetCode problem, a brief description, the core concept(s) involved, and a discussion of the different implementations explored.
* **Language-Specific Directories (`python/`, `java/`, `javascript/`, etc.)**: These directories contain the source code for my solutions in different programming languages, with filenames often indicating the implementation approach (e.g., `solution_hashmap.py`).

    **Example:**

    ```
    problem-solving-log/
    ├── two-sum/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── python/
    │   │   └── solution_hashmap.py
    │   │   └── solution_bruteforce.py
    │   │   └── solution_twopointers.py
    │   └── java/
    │       └── SolutionHashMap.java
    │       └── SolutionBruteForce.java
    └── reverse-linked-list/
        ├── README.md
        ├── python/
        │   └── solution_iterative.py
        │   └── solution_recursive.py
        └── ...
    ```

### 2. Core Concept Exploration (`core-concepts/`)

This directory focuses on fundamental programming concepts and their implementation across different languages. Each concept has its own subdirectory:

* **`README.md`**: An overview of the core concept and discussions of different ways to implement it.
* **Language-Specific Directories**: Containing code examples illustrating the concept in various programming languages.

    **Example:**

    ```
    core-concepts/
    ├── arrays-lists/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── python/
    │   │   └── basic_operations.py
    │   ├── java/
    │   │   └── BasicOperations.java
    │   └── ...
    ├── sorting-algorithms/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── python/
    │   │   ├── bubble_sort.py
    │   │   ├── merge_sort.py
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── java/
    │       ├── BubbleSort.java
    │       ├── MergeSort.java
    │       └── ...
    └── ... (other concepts like linked lists, trees, searching, etc.)
    ```

## How to Navigate This Repository

* **To see solutions for a specific LeetCode problem:** Navigate to the `problem-solving-log/` directory and find the subdirectory for that problem. The `README.md` within will provide context and links to the solutions in different languages.
* **To explore different implementations of a core concept:** Go to the `core-concepts/` directory and choose the concept you're interested in. The `README.md` will give an overview, and the language-specific directories will contain example implementations.

## Contributions and Feedback

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, I'm open to constructive feedback and discussions on the approaches taken. Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have insights to share!

Thank you for exploring my LeetCode journey!
